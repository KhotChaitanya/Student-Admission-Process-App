## 📝 How It Works
- User starts at the **Login Screen** and can register if not already signed up.
- On successful login, user is redirected to the **Dashboard** where they can update or display their details.
- Data is stored and retrieved from **SQLite Database**.
- Logout returns the user back to the Login screen.
